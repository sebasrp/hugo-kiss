# Hugo KISS

## Keep It Simple, Stupid

hugo-kiss is a Hugo theme written as an experiment. While looking for hugo themes, I couldn't really find anything that was simple, hackable, and that was minimalist and light. So I created this theme! It's supposed to follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. Main requiremetns were to for it to me minimalist, small in size and reactive.

I will probably add things like commetns etc in a later time.

## Installation

In your Hugo website directory, create a new folder named theme and clone the repo

```bash
$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/sebasrp/hugo-kiss/.git
```

Edit the `config.toml` file with `theme="hugo-kiss"`
For more information read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/installation/) of Hugo.
